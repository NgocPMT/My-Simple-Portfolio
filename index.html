        <p>
          Hi! I'm Nathan,
          <strong>a student of FPT University from Viet Nam</strong>, I has been
          on my <strong>web development</strong> learning journey for a few
          months now, and I would say it's a wonderful experience!
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently learning <strong>HTML, CSS and Javascript</strong> from
          "Web Design for Everyone" course. It's a great course, I learned a lot
          from it, but that's not enough Javascript for my own need. Maybe I'll
          start another Javascript course before I'm moving to
          <strong>ReactJS and NodeJS</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to see what I has been working on so far, there are
          separated page for my works. You can click on the block below to
          directly go to that page!
